Samples were ripped from the .spc file using [spc2it](https://github.com/uyjulian/spc2it) and converted/imported using OpenMPT, Audacity and [tomeko.net file to hex converter](https://tomeko.net/online_tools/file_to_hex.php).

*Like on most, if not all the music I made using this engine, I wrote "AA1" instead of "AAB" in the pattern documentation.*
