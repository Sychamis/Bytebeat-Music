This was the most complex bytebeat I ever made at the time I released it. I used instruments like supersaws, filtered leads, drums and Karplus-Strong bass sequenced in more than a hundred patterns.

*Like on most, if not all the music I made using this engine, I wrote "AA1" instead of "AAB" in the pattern documentation.*
